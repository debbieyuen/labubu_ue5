# The Labubu Twins

## Requirements
* Unreal Engine 5.6.1
* Epic Games Launcher
* Windows computer (MetaHuman Creator is not compatible with MacOS and there is no longer an updated web version)
* All MetaHuman Plugins (requires Engine restart)

## Setup 

**Step 1:** Install the [Epic Games Launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download) and then install engine version [5.6.1](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-5-6-release-notes). 

**Step 2:** Once you have completed the installation process for Unreal Engine, under the `Library` tab, click on the arrow button within the yellow `Launch` button. Select `Options` and then enable *MetaHuman Creator Core Data*. 

**Step 3:** You may either start with a blank project or fork this repository. If you are creating a blank project, we will be starting with the *3rd Person* template, which includes rigged humanoid characters by default. If you are interested in cloning our sample project you may run the following commands:

First, make sure [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.com) is installed. You may then check to make sure it is installed correctly and working in your directory folder by running: 
```
git lfs install
```
Next, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/debbieyuen/labubu_ue5
```

**Step 4:** Install all the Metahuman plugins and restart the Editor. Once your Engine has successfully restarted, navigate to your *Conent Browser* and select `MetaHuman/`.
